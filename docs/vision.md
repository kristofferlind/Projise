#Vision

##Background and problem statement
Available systems for project management have bad user experience, slow information flow, misdirected focus and are either too complex or too restricted. This results in the use of either whiteboards and post-its or spreadsheets. Neither of which utilize the possibilities of modern technology. This means documents has to manually be kept in sync, a lot of unnecessary steps for common operations and no solutions for analyzing statistics, automatic amendments or generally helping the user. Possibilities for teaching the user about the process are also lost.

The aim of Projise is to be a collaborative real-time project management system based on Scrum. It should have a simple user interface focused on workflow and views tailored to interests of different roles.

##Users

##Market
Freedcamp - More of a community with the possibility of uploading files.  
Basecamp - Very social approach, textfiles and upload, no task management, no help.  
Trello - nice social task management, everything else missing.  
Taiga - Lots of hype, very good looking UI, clunky workflow, buggy and no realtime updates.
